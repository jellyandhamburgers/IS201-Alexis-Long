    <p>Playing "Perfectly": An Op-Ed I Wrote 2 Years Ago.</p>
    <p>
        My fifth grade orchestra teacher would yell at anyone who played their instrument off-key. Forty-five kids were sitting in cold metal chairs, staring blankly at sheet music they didn’t understand. Then there were the ten. The ten fifth graders who practiced for hours on end, sat at the front of the ensemble, and picked up the rest of our slack. <p/>
        <p>Each rehearsal we slid the bow quietly back and forth across the strings of our violins, hoping the kids who knew what they were doing would drown out our mistakes. The Fifth-grade Concert sounded unexpectedly beautiful, but the music notes on the paper in front of me looked foreign. They crawled up and down the page like little ants, scurrying onto the next page quicker than my mind could comprehend. Instead of softly gliding the bow along the strings, I made it hover. I was playing on the air settled between the bow and violin. I felt stupid. Inadequate. Music swirled upward and wafted towards the audience’s ears. They were smiling, but I wasn’t playing. I looked around and found others strumming a centimeter of air as well. The ten were the only ones playing. 
        To be perfect at violin is simply impossible, but that is what every fifth-grader wanted. If they weren't perfect, they didn’t try.</p>
        <p>In our Christian culture, it's normal to idolize perfection. To crave becoming so. We seek to become more like Christ, and by striving to act as He would, we are achieving the ultimate latter-day saint goal. We serve our neighbors, feed the hungry, and dedicate countless hours to loving those who don’t receive love often. We emulate selflessness endlessly to those around us. Why are we so indifferent when it comes to our own souls? If we make one mistake, we limit the amount of love we give to ourselves. We wrongly believe our imperfection needs to be drowned out. </p>
        <p>Each of our wards have “model” members. The few that have a solid faith, stand tall in adversity, and hold few mistakes: The mother who’s got it all together, the teen who reads the bible fervently (and has quite a few verses memorized), and the father with the strong testimony and large capacity to invoke a spiritual message. They play the religious violin with ease. 
        While very admirable, these members become the new Christian goal, pushing others to seek out a lifestyle similar to that of the model group, no matter how much of a facade it truly is. We want to live that seemingly perfect life, with perfect character, and perfect families. We look down upon any mistakes and sweep them under the rug to maintain the appearance of decency.</p> 
        <p></p>
        <p>“Your family is perfect!”</p>
        <p>“You’ve got life figured out!”</p>
        <p>“I wish I had your life!”</p>

        <p>My family is far from perfect. Girls in my Young Women's group saw our facade, and believed it. My house was the one all the kids hung out at, as my mom taught us how to make crafts and baked us cookies each weekend. We went on vacations and sent out elaborate Christmas cards staging our smiling faces and highlighting the achievements of each family member. The girls who admired my life didn’t understand the reality of it. I came home from school to arguing parents, and no one would have guessed. Our family brushed the unwanted circumstances under the rug and made sure to tend to our “image.”  We didn’t want anyone at church to think negatively of our family. We liked the comfort in appearing perfect. </p>
        <p> Had we felt comfortable enough to be vulnerable, and take down our wall of “perfection”, life as a Christian would’ve been sentimental, raw, and genuine. The beauty of vulnerability, however scary it may seem, is that it fosters the necessary connections we need to feel loved. If the church curated an environment that accepted imperfection and encouraged members to speak openly about struggles, families wouldn’t worry so much about their image— they would focus on loving people as they are. </p>
        <p>The LDS members and their praise of perfection stunts the grace found in growth. With growth comes the inevitable mistakes we make, and we need to understand the great reformation of spirituality that follows.</p>
        <p>Just as my music teacher scolded those who played off-key, military drill sergeants scold trainees for falling out of line. Sometimes mistake recognition builds discipline and pushes the individual to strive for improvement. However, this recognition should be constructive rather than destructive. We can’t have members subconsciously judging those who stumble in life.</p>
        <p>Mistakes are supposed to be made; life is meant to be dysfunctional. The desire to be that “model member” chastises mistakes. And while this desire is certainly valid, many see this achievement of almost-perfection as an indicator of how strong their faith is, and how good they are as people. We must realize that mistakes don’t lessen us as people or define how much faith we have in God. If we step towards embracing each other's flaws, we strip ourselves of that unattainable idea of perfection and accept the highs and lows of life.</p>
        <p>When I say embrace flaws, I should emphasize that it means to see each other as humans rather than fallen angels. Our church teaches the Atonement is a key component to returning to our Father again, and Christ, the man we strive to be more like, gives mercy. Gives grace. His Atonement highlights the idea that mistakes must happen for us to evolve —to improve. Don’t shy away from those mistakes; open your heart and let people love you as you are.</p>
        <p>Instead of drowning out imperfections, it's best to give people the love they need to grow. The love we give has a profound effect on the lives of those around us. It catalyzes a metamorphosis in the soul. Christ, rather than whispering of man’s wrongdoings, chose to sit with those who stumbled. He spoke with them, loved them as they were, and offered his heart to them. Unconditional love is needed in our community, and by keeping our arms open to the people who make “undesirable” mistakes (including ourselves), we let them know that we are here every step of the way.</p>
        <p>Don’t drown out your flaws by creating a perception of perfection. Play your religious violin as loud as you can. No matter how squeaky and off key it sounds. The only audience of yours is Heavenly Father. He knows you are trying. </p>
