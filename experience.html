                        <p>Alexis always had a lust for involvement in government procedures, no matter the setting. She was a student council geek— running for cabinet positions from third grade to senior year of high school (there was something so fulfilling about using the gavel during weekly meetings). Alexis found joy in influencing peers to become active community members. Student Body President seems so small of an accomplishment now, but small changemaking inevitably leads to a craving for influencing others on a larger-scale.</p>

                        <p>Alexis is currently working on growing her new clothing business. She is attempting to market her products through a different angle by being genuine and real. Alexis fills her journals to the edges with poems and thoughts, and is using her writing as inspiration for clothing design. Her shirts and hats showcase the beauty of living presently and loving BIG. Now, her customers can (quite literally) wear their hearts on their sleeves.</p> 

                        <p>She is also adamant about seeking the uncomfortable. It’s the only environment in which substantial growth occurs. Alexis interned under the owners of a large business in Texas over the summer (far from the comfort of San Diego or Provo). Living in an unfamiliar place and knowing no one pushed her to stretch her limits. She learned how to connect with people quicker, how to effectively market, and how to find comfort in the little aspects of life. The way the sun sparkles during her afternoon conference call. The small laughter of the kids at the local frozen yogurt shop. The way every Texan suburb had giant fountains that looked pink under the light of the stars. No matter where life takes her now, Alexis wants to be uncomfortable. She wants something that will stretch her. Because life isn’t meant to be stagnant.</p> 

                        <p>Alexis is a member of BYU’s Women in Business club, and has actively involved herself in Youth Jury, Model United Nations, and humanitarian clubs in the past. </p>
